# Visual-Data-Processing
There are codes of the project in my Computer Vision classes.
Most of them got marks above the median level.

Four parts are included:
1. DFT and DCT
2. DWT
3. Image classification
4. Image Rectification

Hope these codes can help you!
# Please go to different branches to access :)
